# lsp-actions
A very dead-simple vim plugin that creates popup menus so that you can quickly execute key actions from the brilliant [prabirshrestha/vim-lsp](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp) language server plugin.

Press, X in normal mode to make the pop-up appear.

Requires Vim 8.2+ for the popup_menu API calls. 
Actions selected are just the ones I use most frequently. Feel free to fork and submit PRs.
